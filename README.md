# lysia leÃ£o

I'm a front-end developer with over three years of experience, specializing in implementing new features, automating processes, and suggesting improvements. My focus is on front-end engineering and software processes, and I'm always learning and exploring emerging technologies to improve as a code artisan.

I'm also an active member of women's communities in technology, passionate about promoting diversity and inclusion in the tech industry.

On a personal note, I'm a vegetarian and advocate for animal rights and the environment. I've worked on ESG projects in the past and believe in creating a sustainable future for all. ðŸ’š
